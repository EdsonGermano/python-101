# Lesson 0 #

A sort of pre-lession, just to get Python installed, and the
environment set up.

## Download + Install Python ##

### 1. Install Active-Tcl 8.5 ###

Visit the
[ActiveTcl Download Page](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads)
and download the "Mac Disk Image (DMG)" from the "8.5.18.0" row,
**don't click the big button, it's the wrong version**.

After the `.dmg` file has downloaded, run the installer, all of the
default options are fine for what we're doing.

If you get an error complaining that the installer is from an
"unidentified developer", right click on the file and choose "Open".

It will then ask if you're sure, because security.

### 2. Install Python 3.4 ###

Visit the [Python Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and click the yellow button that says "Download Python 3.4.3" at the top of the page.

Once the `.pkg` file has downloaded, run the installer, and again all
of the default options are fine for what we're doing.

## Running Python ##

To start an interactive Python session, run the program called "IDLE"
from the Launchpad.

You may want to change your font settings, as the default text is
*tiny*.

To do that click on the "IDLE" menu and select "Preferences...", then
under the "Fonts/Tabs" settings you should be able to increase the
font size.  

Unless you have much better eyesight than I do, you'll
probably want to bump it up to at least 12 point.

The default font of "Courier" is fine, if you want to change it,
because this is code, you will want a mono-spaced (typewriter style)
font, so that all of your code lines up evenly.

### Experiment ###
Try some things.  Some simple stuff you can do is basic math.  Most
mathematical operators work the way you'd expect in Python.

You can also assign things to variables, if you want to do more
complicated math.

Next time we'll cover doing things more complicated than you can do
with a drug store calculator.
