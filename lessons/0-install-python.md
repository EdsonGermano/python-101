# Lesson 0 #

A sort of pre-lession, just to get Python installed, and the
environment set up.

## Download + Install Python ##

### 1. Install Active-Tcl 8.5 ###

Visit the
[ActiveTcl Download Page](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads)
and download the "Mac Disk Image (DMG)" from the "8.5.18.0" row, 
**don't click the big button, it's the wrong version**.

After the `.dmg` file has downloaded, run the installer, all of the
default options are fine for what we're doing.

If you get an error complaining that the installer is from an
"unidentified developer", right click on the file and choose "Open".

It will then ask if you're sure, because security.

### 2. Install Python 3.4 ###

Visit the [Python Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and click the yellow button that says "Download Python 3.4.3" at the top of the page.

Once the `.pkg` file has downloaded, run the installer, and again all
of the default options are fine for what we're doing.

## Running Python ##

To start an interactive Python session, run the program called "IDLE"
from the Launchpad.
