# The Basics #

Python tends to mostly be used for short programs that are called
"scripts".

Scripts are just a series of commands to be executed by the computer.

Unlike inside of IDLE, if you write a script like:
```python
x = 9
x * x
```

It won't print anything, it will just spend the time to do the computation.

To print things you need to use the `print` command.

For example:
```python
x = 9
print(x * x)
```

Will print `81` out, even if you save it to a file.

Now try creating a script yourself.

From inside of IDLE do "File > New File" then write and save your
program (feel free to copy and paste from above).

After saving the file, you can run it by going to "Run > Run Module"
or by pressing F5 (with the default MacOS settings, this will require
pressing fn + F5).
