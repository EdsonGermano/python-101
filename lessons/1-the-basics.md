# The Basics #

Python tends to mostly be used for short programs that are called
"scripts".

Scripts are just a series of commands to be executed by the computer.

Unlike inside of IDLE, if you write a script like ([no_output.py](../resources/no_output.py)):
```python
x = 9
x * x
```

It won't print anything, it will just spend the time to do the computation.

To print things you need to use the `print` command.

For example ([yes_output](../resources/yes_output.py)):
```python
x = 9
print(x * x)
```

Will print `81` out.
